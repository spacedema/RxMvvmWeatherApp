# RxMvvmWeatherApp
App is based on MVVM architecture. It uses RxSwift as a communication method between each layers: View, ViewModel and Model. For example, user interactions are delivered from View to ViewModel via PublishSubject, data is exposed by properties or Observable properties. For web requests RxAlamofire is used.
